Large scale 3d level set simulator for polycrystalline thin film growth.

It generates a large number of crystals and grows them up using various ray effects. It stores the grid in a giant multi-dimensional array that is grown and shrunk as needed. It does several forms of visualization including isometric ray tracing.

This is the code used to generate the data for the paper
