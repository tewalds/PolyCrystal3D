TODO:

- 3d view, ray traced
  - shadows
  - perspective
  - solid sides
  - parallelization


- deal with overhangs

- faster diffusion
  - fix Grid::set_diffprob


Paper: Ballistic Deposition Level Set Simulation
Only self shadowing, enough diffusion to make facets, but infinite schwobel barrier between faces
1. compare growth dependence on crystal orientation to BD model texture, roughness, grain area, self-affinity (functional form)
2. dependence on ray anyle
3. Influence of geometry on BD, l/sqrt(A), try various shapes: 3, 4, 6, 8, etc faces to fastest growth direction
4. Initial Distribution, try random vs 1,0,0, 1,1,1, etc, try non-rotated cubes
